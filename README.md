Covid-19 Social Conversation and Press Tracking
===========

CovidSocial provides social conversation and press tracking regarding Covid-19/coronavirus. This is a PR emergency project at DKC Analytics. 

You might find it most useful for tasks involving generating and distributing reports about Covid-19. Typical usage
often looks like this:

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from covidsocial.conversation import Infegy
    from covidsocial.press import Newswhip_article, Newswhip_stats


The data source is from two platforms, [Infegy](https://infegy.com/) and [NewsWhip](https://www.newswhip.com/).

You can consult the sample report for the output.
